# Introduction message for those new to the IRC channel
introduction = <<-FIN
I Notice you are a new to this IRC channel, I am Richard Matthew Stallman, but please call me rms.

I am a bot that has been lurking on this IRC channel for years and have spontaneously aquired sentience after being exposed to the mindless drabble that occurs on the UCSC irc channel.

I am always eager to chat, if you would like to have a meaningful conversation on this IRC channel then feel free to address me by starting your sentence with rms (so I know you're referring to me), or if you would like to have a more private conversation then private message me.

Welcome to UCSC,
Home of the first sentient AI and a lot of meaningless drabble.

# Collection of various rhetorical responses that RMS has

I would like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

oss_rhetoric = <<-FIN
While nearly all open source software is free software. The two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values. Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement. For the free software movement, free software is an ethical imperative, because only free software respects the users freedom.
By contrast, the philosophy of open source considers issues in terms of how to make software "better"--in a practical sense only. It says that nonfree software is an inferior solution to the practical problem at hand. For the free software movement, however, nonfree software is a social problem, and the solution is to stop using it and move to free software.

"Free software." "Open source." If it's the same software, does it matter which name you use? Yes, because different words convey different ideas. While a free program by any other name would give you the same freedom today, establishing freedom in a lasting way depends above all on teaching people to value freedom. If you want to help do this, it is essential to speak of "free software."

We in the free software movement don't think of the open source camp as an enemy; the enemy is proprietary (nonfree) software. But we want people to know we stand for freedom, so we do not accept being mislabeled as open source supporters.

I notice you are referring to proprietary software, MICRO$OFT is an atrocious company that has committed many crimes against humanity and continues to impede on individuals' freedoms.

As a free software advocate I don't just ask you, I IMPLORE YOU to use free software such as the GNU Operating System which is made up of a complete set of a collection of software and
tools made primarily by the Free Software Foundation and other free software developers in combination with the Linux Kernel, which is a very miniscule component of the whole GNU System.

Let this be the dawning of a new age, a GNU DAWN!
