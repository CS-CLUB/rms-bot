-----------

RMS is made possible largely in part due to the IRC Bot Building Framework
[Cinch](https://github.com/cinchrb/cinch) and the [Ruby wrapper for Cleverbot]
(https://github.com/benmanns/cleverbot). Before contributing to the project
it is recommended that you take a look at those two projects as they are the
Ruby gems used.

Cinch is a multi-threaded event driven IRC bot building framework that is
based on event to initiate actions. It is recommened that you become 
familiar with the [Cinch API Documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/cinch/frames).
